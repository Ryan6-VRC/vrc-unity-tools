    /// <para><b>Three chars per component, not four — and the reason is not float32.</b> Twelve chars at
    /// 6 bits is 72 bits. Four-per-component (24 bits) is exactly float32's integer-exact ceiling
    /// (2^24), so it round-trips through a <c>Vector4</c> perfectly well in isolation. It does NOT
    /// survive the toolchain: d4rkAvatarOptimizer bakes material properties into generated shader
    /// source as text via <c>$"{float}"</c> (<c>d4rkAvatarOptimizer.cs:4565</c>), which is
